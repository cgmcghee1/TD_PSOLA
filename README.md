# TD_PSOLA

Implementation of the TD-PSOLA algorithm as demonstrated in this video http://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/module-5-speech-synthesis-waveform-generation/videos/td-psola/. If you are using pip you can install the required packages using the following command:

<p>$ pip install -r requirements.txt </p>

Voicing and peak detection could be better, all the settings are set-up for this specific clip. Usage would be:

<p>TD_PSOLA.shift()</p>
